# Encrypter
Encrypter for text files

To use, first clone the project. Then, scroll down to line 100 on the main.py file. Uncomment out the code you want to use, depending if you want to encode, decode, or test the program. The code is labelled respectively.
To encrypt:
Create a file called "text.txt". In this, write down your message to be encrypted, and run it with Python 3.7 or later to encrypt it. The output will be in a file called "code.txt". Your key will be in the python shell output.
To decrypt:
Make sure the "code.txt" file is in the same directory. Then, change the second parameter of the decrypt function to be your key. Upon running, the message will be printed to the python shell output.
